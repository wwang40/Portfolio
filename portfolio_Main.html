     <p style="color: rgb(12, 33, 51);">Hi, my name is William Wang. 
        I am a current freshman at Cornell University, pursuing a degree in computer science and a possible minor. 
        My favorite hobbies are cooking, video games, rowing & music. 
        I love baking and frying for cooking but do it rarely due to lack of time to prep. 
        Most of my free time I am playing video games, listening to music and watching tv shows.
        Some of my favorite tv shows are Bojack Horseman, Arcane, Dark.  
        I usually play valorant but I have enjoyed many single player games such as Hades, Hollow Knight and Elden Ring. 
        My favorite music genres are hiphop and R&B. Some of my favorite artists include JID,  Tyler the Creator, JPEGMAFIA, Ari Lennox, SZA, Sudan Archives, Kendrick and much more. 
        Also, I am currently learning how to play the trumpet.
        Sometimes instead of wasting away my time, I try to develope my CS skills.
        Currently, I'm trying to learn the basics of web development, but hope to gain skils
        in machine learning and UX design.<p>
